## UMKC MostFunGroup
This project is an implementation of an earthquake database created as a team (named MostFunGroup) for COMP-SCI 470 at UMKC. COMP-SCI 470 is Introduction to Database Management Systems. We are examining the organization and relationships of earthquake data.

### Earthquake DB
The database stores various information about earthquakes, such as the date/time, location, magnitude, and if it has created a tsunami. An earthquake causes damage, happens in a location, could belong to a cluster, and could affect an insurance policy.

Our database allows a user to search earthquakes, clusters, and locations. A user may want to view insurance policies as affected by earthquakes in the policy area.
